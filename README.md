# Java_Intro_Project
By Kush Patel
This project was the my intro to Java

It includes use of object oriented programing, inheritance, and interfaces to make my own custom forms of queue and stack data structures.
These data structures can do what basic stack and queue data structures can do and can be iterated through in different ways. 

Implementation instructions:
This is a Maven project so it required all files to be arranged in proper format

To compile and run use commands:
1. mvn clean
2. mvn compile
3. mvn test-compile
4. mvn test
