// Description: This project is meant to help understand
// java through practicing with inheritance, generic class,
// interfaces, and testing. An abstract class GenericList<T>
// will be created and have 2 children GenericStack and 
// GenericQueue which represent my implementation of the
// stack and queue data structures through linked list.
// There will be custom iterators created to iterate
// forward, backword, or from a specific index
